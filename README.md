## plugin-builder
Aurelia application designed to assist the process of building Aurelia plugins

### Introduction
This project is inspired by the experience the [Aurelia-UI-Tooolkits](https://github.com/aurelia-ui-toolkits) team collected in the process of building the [Aurelia-KendoUI-plugin](https://github.com/aurelia-ui-toolkits/aurelia-kendoui-plugin) component. Once implemented, this application will superseed the current [Skeleton-plugin](https://github.com/aurelia/skeleton-plugin)
